Dear noedtwins,

As the original author of this project I had to cease development and remove all copies of the binaries and sourcecode for MB-MediaDownloader.
I no longer wish to be associated with this project whatsoever and this fork is the last remaining copy. 

Could I politely ask that you delete this repository too? I would very much appreciate it.

Thank you.
